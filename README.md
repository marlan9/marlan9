- 👋 Howdy, I’m @marlan9
- 👀 I’m just getting started on my dev journey. I'd like to leverage my secular experience in audio + acoustics into a dev role at a TAAGSx company.
- 🌱 Using the freecodecamp curriculum and other open-source CS resourses, I’m currently brushing up on CSS and learning data structures, algos, and OOP principles.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on most things.
